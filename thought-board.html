        <p>
            *ALL THOUGHTS WILL BE PUBLIC ONCE PLACED* <br>
            Type your thought in the text box and click add. Move your thought
            to your desired location on the thought board and click place. This
            will publically publish your thought in that position. If you think
            your thought is better than a thought currently on the board,
            place your thought on top of it. Theoretically, the thought
            board will one day display only the best thoughts. Each thought must be
            below 100 characters. Each user is
            currently limited to a maximum of 3 thoughts in a 24 hour period.
