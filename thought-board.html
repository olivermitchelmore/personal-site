        <h3>Thought board instructions</h3>
        <p>
            *ALL THOUGHTS WILL BE PUBLIC ONCE PLACED* <br>
            Type your thought in the text box and click add. Drag your thought
            to your desired location on the thought board and click submit. This
            will publicly publish your thought in that position. The board is self
            moderating: if you think
            your thought is better than a thought currently on the board,
            place your thought on top of it. Theoretically, the thought
            board will one day display only the best thoughts. Each thought cannot be more
            than 50 characters. Each user is
            currently limited to a maximum of 3 thoughts within a 24 hour period.
